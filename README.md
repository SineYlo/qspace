Site topic: `Work with people`  
Site language: `EN`

### 📚 What was implemented by me:

- In principle, one could say there is nothing interesting on this site if it were not for the circles in the Hero section, which are located on the right (at first I even had doubts about how to implement them)

### 🐍 My comments on this work:

🔸 Probably one of the coolest designs I've worked with so far (considering the fact that it was my 5th or 6th job)  
🔸 In terms of the quality of the designer's work, I would not say that everything is straightforward, but bearable  
🔸 The last thing I want to say is that there are too many sticks and circles in this layout, I don't like this
